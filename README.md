# Summary #

Pandoc template files that I use to typeset various forms of materials

Currently includes:

*   Article format to be used with custom `baderart` class that typesets articles in a custom format using LaTeX

The files depend on [pandoc][] and TeX distribution capable of typsetting LaTeX being installed, and make use of the [pandoc-xnos][] suite of filters created by [Thomas Duck][tomduck].
